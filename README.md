# Fitted-State-Space Tool

This is a methodology for constructing a state-space representation of a black-box-type Voltage Source Converter (VSC) using its input-output frequency response characterization. The proposed approach operates within the synchronous reference frame (dq0), where the VSCâ€™s admittance (for impedance improvements will be come later) is identified in the frequency domain. By applying a method based on the Pole-Collapsing Column Fitting (PCCF), a linear and stable state-space model is obtained. To ensure model accuracy while reducing computational complexity, order-reduction techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and balanced realization are utilized.

# How to use:

- Copy all the functions to the common project folder.
- Use the function "FittedStateSpace2" to determine the state-space model.

# Tutorial:
  
  Run the file "example_fitss.m" and follow the structure of the inputs and outputs.
