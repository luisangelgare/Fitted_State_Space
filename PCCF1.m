% PCCF1: Performs vector fitting and SVD/balanced realization while checking stability.
    % Inputs:
    %   Y - Frequency response data (complex 1xfd0 vector)
    %   j*2*pi*fd0 - Complex frequency points (rad/s)
    %   poles - Initial poles (complex vector)
    %   weight - Weight vector for fitting
    %   pole_tol - Tolerance for pole convergence
    %   red_mode is the reduced-order methodology for the fitted state-space
