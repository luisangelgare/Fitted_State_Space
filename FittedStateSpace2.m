function fitted_ss = FittedStateSpace2(Yqd0_full, fd0, poles1, pole_tol, red_mode)
    
    % FittedStateSpace2: Version 2 of the function that generates a 
    % state-space model using vector fitting

    % Inputs descritption:
    % - Yqd0_full is the [2, 2, fd0] matrix with all the frequency (Hz) measurements.
    % - fd0 is a 1xfd0 real-positive vector which contains the frequency measurements in Hz.
    % - poles1 are the starting complex poles for the fitting process.
    % - pole_tol is the convergence tolerance for the pole iteration.
    % - red_mode is the reduced-order methodology for the fitted state-space:
    % - 1 -> State-space balanced realization (BR) [default].
    % - 2 -> State-space by singular value descomposition (SVC).
